/*
Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation:
The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:
Input: n = 128
Output: 1
Explanation:
The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:
Input: n = 2147483645
Output: 30
Explanation:
The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.
